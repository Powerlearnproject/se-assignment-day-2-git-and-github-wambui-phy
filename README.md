## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is essential for developers and devops engieers to manage code effeciently and collaborate seamlessly. It also helps developers to revert selected files back to the previous version. it also helps developers to experiment with different approaches by branching codes.
Github is  popular tool because it facilitates collaboration and version control for managing codes and documentation.
